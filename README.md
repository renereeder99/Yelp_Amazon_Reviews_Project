This project is a neural network trained on 600000 amazon and yelp reviews. The goal of this project was to predict the star rating of a review based solely on reviewtext. 

The reviews contain 'reviewtext' and 'stars', with stars ranging from 1-5. We then segment the star ratings into three categories: 'low', 'mid', and 'high'.

The model achieves a >90% accuracy on the test split.

The amazon reviews and yelp reviews are publicly accessible databases.
